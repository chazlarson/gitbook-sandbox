Useful for migrating server to server.

# Overview

1. Destination
   
   1. Dependencies

   1. Preinstall

   1. Login as user

   1. Setup and enable rsync server



      ```
      sudo nano /etc/rsyncd.conf
      ```

      Format:
      ```
      [rsync_name]
          path = /path/to/backups/as/specified/in/local/destination/in/backup_config.yml
          comment = Backup folder
          uid = seed
          gid = seed
          read only = no
          list = yes
      ```



      Example:
      ```
      [backup]
          path = /home/seed/Backups/Cloudbox/Cloudbox
          comment = Backup folder
          uid = seed
          gid = seed
          read only = no
          list = yes
      ```


      Start Rsync:

      ```
      sudo systemctl start rsync
      ```


   1. Create backup folder.

      ```
      mkdir -p /home/seed/Backups/Cloudbox/Cloudbox
      ```

1. Source

   1. Create SSH key


      ssh-keygen


      ```
      âžœ ssh-keygen
      Generating public/private rsa key pair.
      Enter file in which to save the key (/home/seed/.ssh/id_rsa):
      Created directory '/home/seed/.ssh'.
      Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
      Enter same passphrase again:
      Your identification has been saved in /home/seed/.ssh/id_rsa.
      Your public key has been saved in /home/seed/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
      The key fingerprint is:
      SHA256:PLaFOPjdddFV2ePo6hRnctslaeWEq9wLnbD89/rkkVE seed@mediaserver
      The key's randomart image is:
      +---[RSA 2048]----+
      |          .o   oo|
      |         .. o .. |
      |      . .  . . .E|
      |     . * .  o .o.|
      |    . = S +=+*+o.|
      |     . = * *O++oo|
      |      . o o..o.+.|
      |         ..   ooo|
      |         ..   .+=|
      +----[SHA256]-----+
      ```


   1. Send SSH key to Destination server.
   
       ```
       ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa seed@ipaddress
       ```

       Type in your password to confirm.

       ```
       /usr/bin/ssh-copy-id: INFO: Source of key(s) to be installed: "/user/seed/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

       Number of key(s) added:        1

       Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh 'seed@newserveripaddress'"
       and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.
       ```


   1. Test rsync URL.
   
   
       Format
       ```
       rsync -rdt rsync://user@newserveripaddress/rsync_name
       ```


       Example:
       ```
       rsync -rdt rsync://seed@1.2.3.4/backup
       ```

   1. Setup backup config.
   
   
       backup_config.yml

       Format:
       ```yaml
       rsync:
         enable: true
         destination: rsync://user@newserveripaddress/rsync_name
       ```



       Example:

       ```yaml
       local:
         enable: false
         destination: /home/{{user}}/Backups/Cloudbox/Cloudbox
       rclone:
         enable: false
         destination: whatever
       rsync:
         enable: true
         destination: rsync://seed@1.2.3.4/backup
       ```

   1. Run backup.

1. Destination

   1. Verify local backup folder has backup tarballs.

   1. Run restore
