### SECURITY

- To setup a login: 

    1. Set a "ControlUsername" and "ControlPassword".

    1. Set an "AddUsername" and "AddPassword" to protect API access.

    1. Select "Form Auth" to `Yes`

    1. Click "Save" and then "Reload".

### DOWNLOAD QUEUE

- DiskSpace: `250000` (or your preference)

  - Will prevent NZBGet from filling up your drive. 

  - 250GB is a generous amount to leave for other tasks (e.g. extractions, backups, etc).


### CHECK AND REPAIR

- HealthCheck: `Delete`

  - Will keep your intermediate folder from filling up with unrepairable downloads.
