To use Cloudbox, you will need to choose which method you will use to download your media with. It can either be [Usenet, Torrents, or both](https://www.htpcguides.com/comparing-usenet-vs-torrents/).

### i. Usenet

If you plan on using [Usenet](https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/wiki/faq#wiki_usenet_faq) (i.e. Newsgroups) with Cloudbox, you'll need 2 things: a [Usenet provider](https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/wiki/providers) and a [Usenet indexer](https://www.reddit.com/r/usenet/wiki/indexers). We recommend you have multiple indexers (and even multiple providers) to better your chances of finding/downloading media.


### ii. BitTorrent

If you plan on using torrents with Cloudbox, we recommend you have access to a [private torrent tracker](https://www.reddit.com/r/trackers/wiki/getting_into_private_trackers) as most servers don't allow public ones. However, if you still want to use public torrent trackers with Cloudbox, you are free to do so.
