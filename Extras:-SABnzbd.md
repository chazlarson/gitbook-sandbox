< Rough guide >

- Install tag: `--tags sabnzbd`
- After setup wizard finishes, it will try to redirect to `domain:8080`. Just take out the `:8080` part from the url and you can continue with the rest of the setup. This wont happen again. 
- Login is set with what's in accounts.yml
- User will  need to add in categories for `sonarr`, `radarr`, and `lidarr`. Was also not able to do that without server already filled in.
- Direct unpack is disabled by default. Left it as-is for user to setup basics.
