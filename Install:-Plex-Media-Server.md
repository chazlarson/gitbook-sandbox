## 3. Settings

### Remote Access

1. Click the Settings icon (top right) &rightarrow; "Server" (top) &rightarrow;  "Remote Access" (left).

1. Enable "Manually specify public port", type in `443`, and click the "Retry" button. 

1. You will get a "Not available outside your network" message. This is OK. Simply ignore it and click "ENABLE REMOTE ACCESS".

### Library

1. Click the Settings icon (top right) &rightarrow; "Server" (top) &rightarrow; "Library" (left).

1. Set the following:

   - "Empty trash automatically after every scan": `disabled`

     - _Plex Autoscan will take care of this._

   - "Allow media deletion": `enabled`

   - "Generate video preview thumbnails": `never`

   - "Generate chapter thumbnails": `never`

> The reasoning behind disabling these thumbnails is related to Google Drive API usage, data transfer, and disk space.  Accessing large portions of a given video file to generate thumbnails *may* generate large numbers of Google Drive API calls, and large amounts of data transfer.  Either of these things *may* result in your account suffering one of the various types of 24-hour bans Google hands out, which *may* prevent your server from playing media at all.  Also, storing these images *will* greatly inflate the size of `/opt/plex`, which can affect the speed of backups, your ability to download, and anything else related to disk space usage.  These are generally considered Bad Things, so the recommendation is to avoid the possibility by turning these options off.

1. Click "SAVE CHANGES".

## 5. Scan Media libraries

As mentioned in the [[Introduction|Basics: Introduction#how-does-cloudbox-function-]] page, [[Plex Autoscan| Install: Plex Autoscan]] will automatically scan the media files into Plex as they are downloaded, but this will require the Plex database to not be completely empty. So for every new library that is added, a one-time, manual scan is required. 

To do so:

1. Click the 3 dots next to a Plex library.

2. Select "Scan Library Files". 

   ![](https://i.imgur.com/38OCwU5.png)

3. Repeat steps 1-2 for each library. 


## 6. Webtools

Webtools for Plex comes preinstalled. If you wish to setup Webtools and install 3rd party add-ons, you can go to http://plex._yourdomain.com_:33400 (http, not https) and login with your Plex account.

_Note: Use http://_yourserveripaddress_:33400 if the above URL doesnt work._
