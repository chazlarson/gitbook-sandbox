Setup instructions are separated based on the DNS Provider you use. 


# Cloudflare

Cloudbox will automatically add subdomain on Cloudflare and point it to the correct IP address. 


_Note 1: Make sure the Cloudflare API Key is filled in [[settings.yml|Install: Settings]]) and the e-mail address matches the one you have in your account profile._ 

_Note 2: There may be some subdomains that you have to add in yourself if Cloudbox doesnâ€™t so it for you, such as the Cloudbox type ones (eg `cloudbox`, `feederbox`, `mediabox`)._
