You'll need a [Plex](https://www.plex.tv) account.

Sign up for a free Plex account at https://www.plex.tv/sign-up/, if you don't already have one. 

It's easiest if you have a Plex account *even if you're not planning to use Plex*.  The default `cloudbox` install assumes that you are using Plex, and without a Plex account in the settings, it will fail in various ways as it tries to install Plex and then things that depends on Plex.  This can be worked around<sup name="a1">[\[1\]](#f1) </sup>, but for now the simplest route is to sign up for that free account, and then disable Plex after install if you don't want to use it.

<sup><b name="f1">[1](#a1)</b> Basically, run the `core` tag instead of the `cloudbox` tag, then run the app tags you want individually. </sup>
