A fully functional Cloudbox requires certain requirements to be met. This page aims to clear this up. 

Cloudbox was designed to be: 

- setup on a remote server. 

- accessed with a personal domain. 

- store media on cloud storage. 

This means that Cloudbox requires:

- a remote server with root-level access. 

- a personal domain. 

- cloud storage provider account. 

Although Cloudbox and its tools can be setup without the aforementioned requirements [for example on a home server], it is outside the scope of this wiki and support channels.
