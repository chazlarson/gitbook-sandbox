The [[previous page|Install: Preinstall]] created a user account for you based on what you had in [[accounts.yml|Install: accounts.yml]].

If you are currently logged in as root, log out and log back in with the user account.

**From now on, you will always log into your server with this account (i.e. not with root).**

Example:

```
ssh yourusername@yourserveripaddress
```

After Cloudbox setup, you may use a subdomain to ssh in if you choose:

```
ssh yourusername@<cloudbox/mediabox/feederbox>.yourdomain.ltd
```
